# BULLETPROOF Boot Detection Testing Guide

## THE REALITY
- **WhatsApp/Telegram work because Xiaomi WHITELISTS them by default**
- **No technical solution can bypass MIUI restrictions**
- **This works ONLY when user enables "Autostart" permission**

## What We Implemented

### 1. Bulletproof Boot Receiver
- Handles ALL boot scenarios (normal, quick boot, HTC devices, package updates)
- Simplest possible code - no complex logic
- Maximum priority (1000) to receive events first
- DirectBootAware for encrypted devices

### 2. Complete Boot Event Coverage
```xml
- BOOT_COMPLETED (standard boot)
- LOCKED_BOOT_COMPLETED (encrypted storage)
- QUICKBOOT_POWERON (MIUI/Samsung restart)
- com.htc.intent.action.QUICKBOOT_POWERON (HTC devices)
- MY_PACKAGE_REPLACED (app updates)
```

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Enable Autostart (CRITICAL)
**On MIUI devices, user MUST enable autostart:**
1. Open Security app
2. Go to "Manage apps" or "Permissions"
3. Find your app
4. Enable "Autostart" permission
5. **WITHOUT THIS, NOTHING WILL WORK**

### 2. Test Boot Detection
```bash
# Install app
flutter build apk
adb install build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# Launch app once (REQUIRED)
adb shell am start -n com.thousandemfla.thanks_everyday/.MainActivity

# Enable services in app
# (Set survival signal or location tracking to ON)

# Test reboot
adb reboot

# Check logs after reboot
adb logcat | grep "BootReceiver_SIMPLE"
```

### 3. Check Boot Log File
```bash
# Check our custom boot log
adb shell cat /data/data/com.thousandemfla.thanks_everyday/files/boot_simple_log.txt
```

### 4. Verify Services Started
```bash
# Check if foreground service is running
adb shell dumpsys activity services | grep ScreenMonitorService

# Check alarms are scheduled
adb shell dumpsys alarm | grep "com.thousandemfla.thanks_everyday"
```

## Expected Results

### ✅ SUCCESS (when autostart enabled):
```
I/BootReceiver_SIMPLE: BOOT DETECTED: android.intent.action.BOOT_COMPLETED
I/BootReceiver_SIMPLE: Services started successfully
```

### ❌ FAILURE (autostart disabled):
- No logs appear
- Services don't start
- This is EXPECTED behavior on MIUI

## User Education Required

**You MUST educate users to:**
1. Enable autostart permission in MIUI Security app
2. Keep app in recent apps list
3. Don't use battery optimization for the app

**Without user cooperation, no technical solution works on MIUI.**
