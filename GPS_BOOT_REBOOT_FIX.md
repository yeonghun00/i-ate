# GPS Boot/Reboot Issue Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-29
**Issue:** GPS tracking fails to start properly after device reboot
**Status:** FIXED
**Severity:** CRITICAL

---

## Problem Summary

### Symptoms
- GPS tracking **fails to start** after device reboot
- Survival signal and battery monitoring **work correctly** after reboot
- GPS tracking **works normally** when app is running (not after reboot)
- GPS should update every 15 minutes **regardless of screen state**
- GPS should also update when **phone is unlocked**

### Expected Behavior
- GPS alarm should be scheduled on boot completion
- GPS should update to Firestore every 15 minutes
- GPS should work whether screen is on or off
- GPS should trigger on phone unlock events

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Bug

**Location:** `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/thousandemfla/thanks_everyday/elder/BootReceiver.kt:68-86`

The GPS initialization code used **`Handler.postDelayed()`** with a **5-second delay** to verify and retry GPS alarm scheduling:

```kotlin
// BROKEN CODE (Before Fix):
if (locationEnabled) {
    AlarmUpdateReceiver.enableLocationTracking(context)

    // Verification with 5-second delay
    android.os.Handler(android.os.Looper.getMainLooper()).postDelayed({
        // Check if GPS was scheduled
        // Retry if failed
    }, 5000) // 5-second delay = TOO LATE!
}
```

### Why This Failed

1. **BroadcastReceiver Lifecycle Issue:**
   - `BootReceiver.onReceive()` completes and returns
   - Android system can **kill the receiver process** immediately after `onReceive()` completes
   - The delayed Handler callback (scheduled for 5 seconds later) **never executes**

2. **Async Callback Never Runs:**
   - Handler is posted to main looper with delay
   - BroadcastReceiver's `onReceive()` method finishes **before** the callback runs
   - System reclaims the receiver process
   - **Verification and retry logic never executes**

3. **Survival Signal Works Because:**
   - Survival signal initialization is **simple and synchronous**
   - No delayed callbacks or async verification
   - Direct call: `AlarmUpdateReceiver.enableSurvivalMonitoring(context)`

### Comparison

```kotlin
// SURVIVAL SIGNAL (WORKS):
if (survivalEnabled) {
    AlarmUpdateReceiver.enableSurvivalMonitoring(context)
    Log.i(TAG, "✅ Survival started")
}

// GPS TRACKING (BROKEN):
if (locationEnabled) {
    AlarmUpdateReceiver.enableLocationTracking(context)

    // PROBLEM: Async verification that never runs!
    Handler.postDelayed({
        // This code NEVER executes after boot
        if (gps_not_scheduled) {
            retry_gps()
        }
    }, 5000)
}
```

## The Fix

### Changes Made

**File:** `android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/thousandemfla/thanks_everyday/elder/BootReceiver.kt:60-108`

#### Before (Broken):
```kotlin
if (locationEnabled) {
    Log.i(TAG, "🌍 Starting GPS tracking (pure alarm approach)...")
    try {
        AlarmUpdateReceiver.enableLocationTracking(context)
        Log.i(TAG, "✅ GPS alarm scheduled (service-free)")

        // BROKEN: Async verification with 5-second delay
        android.os.Handler(android.os.Looper.getMainLooper()).postDelayed({
            val debugPrefs = context.getSharedPreferences("AlarmDebugPrefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
            val lastScheduled = debugPrefs.getLong("last_gps_alarm_scheduled", 0)
            val currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis()

            if (lastScheduled > 0 && (currentTime - lastScheduled) < 30000) {
                Log.i(TAG, "✅ GPS alarm successfully started at boot")
            } else {
                Log.e(TAG, "❌ GPS alarm NOT scheduled - FAILED")

                // Retry (this never runs!)
                try {
                    AlarmUpdateReceiver.enableLocationTracking(context)
                } catch (rescueError: Exception) {
                    Log.e(TAG, "❌ GPS rescue failed: ${rescueError.message}")
                }
            }
        }, 5000) // Never executes!

    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Log.e(TAG, "❌ FAILED to start GPS: ${e.message}", e)
    }
}
```

#### After (Fixed):
```kotlin
if (locationEnabled) {
    Log.i(TAG, "🌍 Starting GPS tracking...")
    try {
        // CRITICAL FIX 2025-10-29: Simplified GPS initialization (same as survival signal)
        // Previous code used Handler.postDelayed() which never executed after boot
        // because BroadcastReceiver lifecycle ends before async callbacks
        AlarmUpdateReceiver.enableLocationTracking(context)
        Log.i(TAG, "✅ GPS tracking started (15-minute intervals)")
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Log.e(TAG, "❌ FAILED to start GPS tracking: ${e.message}", e)

        // Attempt immediate retry if scheduling failed
        try {
            Log.w(TAG, "🔄 Retrying GPS initialization...")
            Thread.sleep(1000) // Brief pause
            AlarmUpdateReceiver.enableLocationTracking(context)
            Log.i(TAG, "✅ GPS tracking started (retry successful)")
        } catch (retryError: Exception) {
            Log.e(TAG, "❌ GPS retry also failed: ${retryError.message}")
        }
    }
}
```

### Key Improvements

1. **Simplified Initialization:**
   - Removed async Handler.postDelayed() verification
   - Matches the working survival signal pattern
   - Executes synchronously before `onReceive()` completes

2. **Immediate Synchronous Retry:**
   - If first attempt fails, retry **immediately** (not after 5 seconds)
   - Uses `Thread.sleep(1000)` for brief pause (synchronous, not async)
   - Executes within the `onReceive()` method lifecycle

3. **Enhanced Rescue Mode:**
   - Improved rescue logic for GPS that was previously active
   - Checks if GPS was active within **last 24 hours** (not just if it ever worked)
   - More intelligent decision-making

### Enhanced Rescue Mode

```kotlin
// RESCUE MODE: Check if GPS was previously working before reboot
val debugPrefs = context.getSharedPreferences("AlarmDebugPrefs", Context.MODE_PRIVATE)
val lastGpsExecution = debugPrefs.getLong("last_gps_execution", 0)
val lastGpsScheduled = debugPrefs.getLong("last_gps_alarm_scheduled", 0)

// If GPS was working within the last 24 hours, force re-enable it
val currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
val oneDayAgo = currentTime - (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000L)
val wasRecentlyActive = lastGpsExecution > oneDayAgo || lastGpsScheduled > oneDayAgo

if (wasRecentlyActive) {
    Log.w(TAG, "⚠️ GPS tracking DISABLED but was active within 24h - ACTIVATING RESCUE MODE")

    try {
        // Force enable GPS tracking and save preference
        prefs.edit().putBoolean("flutter.location_tracking_enabled", true).apply()
        AlarmUpdateReceiver.enableLocationTracking(context)
        Log.i(TAG, "✅ GPS rescue mode activated - tracking restarted")
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        Log.e(TAG, "❌ GPS rescue mode failed: ${e.message}")
    }
}
```

## Technical Details

### GPS Tracking Architecture

#### Components Involved

1. **BootReceiver.kt**
   - Receives `ACTION_BOOT_COMPLETED` broadcast
   - Initializes GPS and survival signal alarms
   - Waits 10 seconds after boot before starting services

2. **AlarmUpdateReceiver.kt**
   - Handles alarm-based GPS updates
   - Schedules repeating 15-minute alarms
   - Executes GPS location updates via `getCurrentLocation()`

3. **ScreenStateReceiver.kt**
   - Receives `ACTION_USER_PRESENT` (phone unlock)
   - Triggers immediate GPS and survival signal updates
   - Restarts services if they haven't executed recently (4-minute threshold)

#### GPS Update Flow

```
Device Boot
    ↓
[Wait 10 seconds]
    ↓
BootReceiver.startServices()
    ↓
Read: flutter.location_tracking_enabled
    ↓
If enabled → AlarmUpdateReceiver.enableLocationTracking()
    ↓
scheduleGpsAlarm() → AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle()
    ↓
[Every 15 minutes]
    ↓
AlarmUpdateReceiver.handleGpsUpdate()
    ↓
getCurrentLocation() → LocationManager
    ↓
Update Firestore: families/{familyId}/location
    ↓
Schedule next alarm (15 minutes)
```

#### Phone Unlock Flow

```
User Unlocks Phone
    ↓
ACTION_USER_PRESENT broadcast
    ↓
ScreenStateReceiver.onReceive()
    ↓
updateFirebase() → Immediate GPS update
    ↓
restartServicesIfNeeded()
    ↓
Check last GPS execution time
    ↓
If > 4 minutes ago → Restart GPS tracking
```

## Testing & Verification

### How to Test the Fix

1. **Enable GPS Tracking:**
   - Open app → Settings
   - Enable "GPS 위치 추적"
   - Verify SharedPreferences: `flutter.location_tracking_enabled = true`

2. **Reboot Device:**
   ```bash
   adb reboot
   ```

3. **Check Logs After Boot:**
   ```bash
   adb logcat | grep -E "BootReceiver|AlarmUpdateReceiver|GPS"
   ```

4. **Expected Logs:**
   ```
   BootReceiver: 🚀 BOOT COMPLETED - Starting services in 10 seconds
   BootReceiver: ⚡ STARTING SERVICES NOW
   BootReceiver: 🎯 FINAL Settings: Survival=true, GPS=true
   BootReceiver: 🌍 Starting GPS tracking...
   AlarmUpdateReceiver: 🌍 Enabling GPS location tracking...
   AlarmUpdateReceiver: ✅ GPS alarm scheduled for 15 minutes
   BootReceiver: ✅ GPS tracking started (15-minute intervals)
   ```

5. **Wait 15 Minutes:**
   - Check Firestore console
   - Verify `families/{familyId}/location` is updated

6. **Test Phone Unlock:**
   - Lock phone → Unlock phone
   - Check logs:
   ```
   ScreenStateReceiver: 🔓 USER UNLOCKED - Updating Firebase + Restarting services
   ScreenStateReceiver: ✅ GPS location + battery updated from screen unlock!
   ```

### Success Criteria

- ✅ GPS alarm scheduled on boot
- ✅ GPS updates Firestore every 15 minutes
- ✅ GPS updates on phone unlock
- ✅ GPS works regardless of screen state
- ✅ Logs show successful alarm scheduling
- ✅ No async Handler callbacks in critical path

## Lessons Learned

### BroadcastReceiver Best Practices

1. **Never use async callbacks in BroadcastReceivers:**
   - `Handler.postDelayed()` is unreliable
   - Receiver process can be killed after `onReceive()` returns
   - All critical work must complete **before** `onReceive()` finishes

2. **Use `goAsync()` for long-running tasks:**
   - If async work is required, use `BroadcastReceiver.goAsync()`
   - Keeps receiver alive for up to 10 seconds
   - NOT used in this fix (synchronous approach is simpler)

3. **Keep it simple:**
   - Synchronous, straightforward code
   - Match patterns that work (e.g., survival signal)
   - Avoid over-engineering

### Debugging Android Boot Issues

1. **Use extensive logging:**
   - Log before and after every critical operation
   - Include timestamps to detect delays
   - Log SharedPreferences state for debugging

2. **Test actual device boots:**
   - Emulator boots may behave differently
   - Real devices have stricter battery optimization
   - `adb reboot` is your friend

3. **Compare working vs broken code:**
   - Survival signal worked → GPS didn't work
   - Side-by-side comparison revealed the difference
   - Simpler code pattern won

## Future Improvements

### Potential Enhancements

1. **First GPS Update on Boot:**
   - Currently waits 15 minutes for first update
   - Could trigger immediate update after boot (with 30-second delay)
   - Would provide faster initial location data

2. **GPS Health Monitoring:**
   - Firebase Function to detect stale GPS data
   - Alert if GPS hasn't updated in > 30 minutes
   - Automatic notification to user if GPS fails

3. **Location Provider Fallback:**
   - Try GPS provider first
   - Fall back to Network provider if GPS unavailable
   - Use Passive provider as last resort

## Conclusion

The GPS boot issue was caused by **asynchronous verification code** that never executed after boot due to BroadcastReceiver lifecycle limitations. The fix simplifies GPS initialization to match the working survival signal pattern, ensuring all critical work completes synchronously before `onReceive()` returns.
