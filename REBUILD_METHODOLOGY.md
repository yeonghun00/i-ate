│   ├── AppStateManager - Global app state coordination
│   ├── FirebaseConnectionManager - Family network management
│   ├── FirebaseActivityManager - Meal and activity tracking
│   ├── FirebaseFamilyManager - Family data operations
│   └── FirebaseMealManager - Meal-specific operations
│
├── Service Delegates (Android Layer)

    members: {
      [userId]: {
        deviceId: string,
        joinedAt: timestamp,
        role: 'primary' | 'member',
        lastSeen: timestamp
      }
    }
  }
}

activities: {
  [activityId]: {
    userId: string,
    familyId: string,
    type: 'meal' | 'location' | 'screen_activity',
    timestamp: timestamp,
